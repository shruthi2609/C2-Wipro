1.The Problem statement :-
b. Create a calculator application using functions

2.Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and, if it
exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with the ellipsis character "…", to make its
length equal to maxlength.
The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.
For instance:
truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20) = "What I'd like to te…"
truncate("Hi everyone!", 20) = "Hi everyone!"


3. We have a cost in the form "$120". That is: the dollar sign goes first, and then the
number.
Create a function extractCurrencyValue(str) that would extract the numeric value from such
string and return the indian currencyvalue.

"INR4000"


4. Write a function filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr, looks for elements with
values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
The function should not modify the array. It should return the new array.
For instance:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1];
let filtered = filterRange(arr, 1, 4);
alert( filtered ); // 3,1 (matching values)
alert( arr ); // 5,3,8,1 (not modified)
